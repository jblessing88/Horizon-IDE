HorizonIDE
==========

This used to be a Senior Project of mine, but I want to update the entire project for the current time. It will be a
large undertaking that will be done over the next few months or so. If you would like to help feel free.

Future goals:
-Convert the entire project to kotlin, still using JavaFX
-Remove the clunky Java Help Panels (those were implemented very poorly)
-There was no structure to the code and tons of god classes. Making the project more testable and maintainable
-Implement a code text area. The previous one only showed code on the screen nothing else.
    -Syntax highlighting
    -Code completions
    -Auto brackets
    -Auto indent
    -Etc
-Rework the Undo manager
-And so much more, but this is a good start
